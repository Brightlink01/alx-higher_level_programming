# Higher-level programming
## This reposistory is for python projects to fullfill the ALX SE(software Engineering) High level programing career path

### Object-oriented programming
(OOP) is a method for organizing programs that brings together many of the ideas introduced in this cha\
pter. Like the functions in data abstraction, classes create abstraction barriers between the use and i\
mplementation of data. Like dispatch dictionaries, objects respond to behavioral requests. Like mutable\
data structures, objects have local state that is not directly accessible from the global environment.\
The Python object system provides convenient syntax to promote the use of these techniques for organiz\
ing programs. Much of this syntax is shared among other object-oriented programming languages.

The object system offers more than just convenience. It enables a new metaphor for designing programs i\
n which several independent agents interact within the computer. Each object bundles together local sta\
te and behavior in a way that abstracts the complexity of both. Objects communicate with each other, an\
d useful results are computed as a consequence of their interaction. Not only do objects pass messages,\
they also share behavior among other objects of the same type and inherit characteristics from related\
types.
