## 0x0B. Python - Input/Output
In this project, I practiced file handling in Python. I used the builtin with, open, and read functions with the json module to read and write files and serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.
#### Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
#### Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:
#### Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added:
#### Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):
#### Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string:
#### Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation:
#### Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”:
#### Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file:
#### Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object:
#### Write a class Student that defines a student by:
#### Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
#### Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)
Now, you have a simple implementation of a serialization and deserialization mechanism (concept of representation of an object to another format, without losing any information and allow us to rebuild an object based on this representation)
####  Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:

Whiteboard first
#### Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string (see example):
#### Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:
