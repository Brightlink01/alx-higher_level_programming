This project is done to fullfill the ALX SE course on python programing of high levele programming language on Exception and try
The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow: in the example, the error is detected at the function
